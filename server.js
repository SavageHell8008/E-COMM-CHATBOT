E-commerce agents should have the\nability to negotiate with each other and search the internet for\nnew products. Negotiation has become very interesting research\nissue. Therefore, this paper introduces an implementation of a\nformal model for E-commerce agent negotiation. The negotiation\nmodel takes into consideration parameters and utility functions to\nevaluate the transaction after each negotiation state.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nRecently, the number of shoppers using the internet is increasing\nexponentially. Merchants recognized this market and adapt their marketing\nstrategy to attract customers through the internet. Surely, customers faced the\ndilemma of who sells the best brands for the lowest price. The electronic\nmarket was going to end up the same as the actual market. Artificial\nintelligent researchers recognize the need for systems that can learn how to\nsolve a problem or perform a task without asking the user how to do it. These\nsystems are called intelligent agents. Compute'r agents represent an excellent\napproach to automate the features of electronic commerce. Agents are\nsoftware components that act on behalf of users, or group of users.\nE-commerce agents are good tool for saving time. They can perform\ntasks efficiently regardless of any modifications of the data. Tasks may\ninclude searching, selling or buving. There are many models for using agents.\nfor example CBB (Consumer Buying Behavior) Model [5], which contains\nmany stages, (Identification of need, Information retrieval and product\nbrokering Brokering of merchant, Negotiation. Purchase, delivery, service\nand evaluation). Each stage may be done by an agent, most of this stages\nhandled by many researches, but this paper handles the stage of negotiation,\nto make the agent more smart and more reliability of the agent to simulate the\nhuman way in negotiation selling, buying things.\nThis paper proposes a system that includes a seller agent, a buyer agent\nand a negotiation strategy for mutual communications. The system helps the\nuser to search and select the most suitable products with minimum effort and\nthe ability to negotiate with the vendor about the price and some other\nfeatures like warranty and delivery.\n2. RELATED WORK\nKasbah [21, 131 agent developed by MIT Media Lab is a Web-based\nmulti agent system. Kasbah allows the user to create autonomous agents\nwhich do the trading tasks instead of users.\nWhenever a User creates an agent (buying/selling) he enters some\nparameters like BestPrice, WorstPrice, Time, and Negotiation Strategy. Once\ncreated, the agent will look for potential Traders (whose list will be provided\nby the server) and starts negotiating with them. While negotiating it uses the\nstrategy provided by the User.\nBut this system did not intend to be a general market infrastructure and\ndoes not offer distribution nor interaction models. After buying agents and\nselling agents are matched, the only valid action in the distributive negotiation\nprotocol is for buying agents to offer a bid to sellers. Selling agents respond\nwith either an answering \"Yes\" or \"No\". Given this protocol, Kasbah provides\nbuyers with one of three negotiation \"Strategies\": anxious, cool-headed, and\nfrugal. This negotiation takes the form of multi-agent, bilateral bargaining but\nuses simple raise or decay functions.\nPmart [41 an agent-mediated electronic commerce framework based on\nthe multiagent to negotiate over prices, product features, warranties, and\nservice policies. This contains a negotiation model which is based on special\nknowledge and general knowledge at the same time. The former is based on\nthe MAUT and the latter is based on the previous successful purchase history\nand the simple heuristics. Pmart framework provides the software reuse and\nthe extensibility based on the object-oriented and software components\ntechnologies.\nMagnet 181 (Mobile AGents for Networked Electronic Trading) is a\nmobile agent based system developed using Javal. I and the IBM Aglets SDK\nwhich enables buyers to compare shopping for items from different online\nsellers. In Magnet, a human buyer creates a mobile shopping aglet that\n436\ncompares quotes for an item from different online sellers by visiting those\nseller sites and etuns to the buyer with the best offer that it obtains.\nThe operation ofMagnet can be divided into the following phases:\n* A human buyer enters the preferences on different attributes including\nprice, delivery time, and quantity for the item he wishes to purchase,\nthrough a GUI on his computer. A stationary controller agent takes this\ninformation from the GUI and updates the internal data structures and\ndatabase on the buyer site. The controller agent then looks up the list of\nonline sellers (stored aprion inside the buyer site's data tables) for each\nitem on the buyers shopping list. For each item the controller agent\ncreates a mobile shopping agent and gives it information about the item\nand the list of online seller sites that sell that item.\n* The mobile shopping agent sequentially visits each seller site on its\nitinerary. At each seller site it talks to a stationary service agent that\ninterfaces with the database on the seller's backend. The service agent\nsubmits the quote from the seller to the shopping agent. The shopping\nagent 6ompares this quote with the offers from other sellers it has\nobtained thus far. If the current quote if the best offer yet, the shopping\nagent reserves the item with the seller and cancels any reservations it\nmight have made at previously visited seller sites.\n* The mobile shopping agent returns back to the buyer's site at the end of its\nitinerary of online sellers and submits the URL of the seller that offered\nthe best quote. The buyer can then either contact the seller directly or\nabort.\n3. NEGOTIATION PROCESS\nNegotiation is a method for coordination and conflict resolution, where\nconflict is understood broadly as any form of goal disparity (for more details\nsee, [6]).\nAs indicated above, it is expected that, on the Intemet, autonomous\nagents will negotiate on behalf of customers. Overall, research on agent\u0002negotiations can be divided into approaches based on game theory and\nartificial intelligence. Game theoretic approaches are directed towards\ndeveloping optimization algorithms (e.g., [7]).\nWe used the formal model of Katia Sycara and Pu Huang \"A\ncomputational Model for online Agent Negotiation\", This model related to\n\"Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI)\" [1] in this model the agent adapt themselves\nto the uncertain environment by using different \"Intention reconsideration\npolicies\" [1], this model based on the idea of getting the maximum payoff\nthrough utility function calculated by each agent.\nThis model considered that each agent has two types of data, public data\nwhich known to all other agents and private data.\n437\nPublic data:\nA,: Set of possible action agents can take.\nTi: Set of possible type agent may be, in this case {buyer, seller}.\nPrivate data:\nri: the real type of the agent.\nUi (s,ri):utility function of agent i, which denotes the payoff agent i will get if\nthe process ends at state s E S, its real type is ri.\nProb-(a1): the probability agent i believes that agent j would take action aj(the\nother side of negotiation process).\nAt each time period t< maxT, if current state is a terminal state s, the\nnegotiation ends and all players obtain their final payoffs U, (s,ri). Otherwise,\nthe negotiation goes forward, player i computes its payoff by the following\nfonnula:\nn\nPayoff,'(s) = max\naieAi { HI Pr ob(a,)x Payoffi' (s')} j=lji\nWhere s' is the state to which the process transfers from state s.\nTo maximize its expected payoff, player i should take action at such that\nn\na, (s) = arg max{ [l Pr ob(a1)x Payoff/'+' (s')}\naieAi j=lj#i\nAt the last period maxT, the payoff is realized as utility function of player i.\ni.e.:\nPayoff max T (s) = Ui(s ,ri)\nWe assume that there is a reservation price for both seller u, and buyer\nuw in each iteration i.\nThe negotiation started at time t and iteration i=1, buyer offered price bt,\nseller offered price st (from the database of the seller).\nAt any time t If t > maxT or b,"}],
